# PHP Symbol Data Builder

Builder for [PHP Symbol Data](https://github.com/PHPWatch/PHP-Symbols): Automatically tracked PHP symbol data such as classes, functions, interfaces, traits, INI values, etc. 

Uses a scheduled GitHub Actions CI job to automatically dump, collect, organize, and commit back the symbol data. These data can then be used to process and track PHP version changes.
